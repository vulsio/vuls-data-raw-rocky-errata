  "description": "The libwebp packages provide a library and tools for the WebP graphics format. WebP is an image format with a lossy compression of digital photographic images. WebP consists of a codec based on the VP8 format, and a container based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Webmasters, web developers and browser developers can use WebP to compress, archive, and distribute digital images more efficiently.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Mozilla: libwebp: Double-free in libwebp (CVE-2023-1999)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
