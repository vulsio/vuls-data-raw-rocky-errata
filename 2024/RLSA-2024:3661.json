	"description": "The Booth cluster ticket manager is a component to bridge high availability clusters spanning multiple sites, in particular, to provide decision inputs to local Pacemaker cluster resource managers. It operates as a distributed consensus-based service, presumably on a separate physical network. Tickets facilitated by a Booth formation are the units of authorization that can be bound to certain resources. This will ensure that the resources are run at only one (granted) site at a time.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* booth: specially crafted hash can lead to invalid HMAC being accepted by Booth server (CVE-2024-3049)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
